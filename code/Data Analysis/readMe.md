# Programs

All the programs are pretty similar. The output differs a bit based on the specific operation each of them carries out.

1. tunivalasa.py - *cleans the data* <br/>
		   *normalizes the data* <br/>
		   *plots the graph for 1 day only* <br/>

2. Narsha.py     - *it plots the graphs for 3 days(the only difference w.r.t tunivalasa.py)* <br/>

3. analytics.py  - *a more generalized(rather a modified version) approach that can 
		     plot for multiple days* <br/>
		   *basically a build up of the previous two versions*
