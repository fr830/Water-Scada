# Programs

All the programs are pretty similar. The output differs a bit based on the specific operation each of them carries out.

1. tunivalasa.py - * cleans the data
		   * normalizes the data
		   * plots the graph for 1 day only

2. Narsha.py     - * it plots the graphs for 3 days(the only w.r.t tunivalasa.py)

3. analytics.py  - * a more generalized(rather a modified version) approach that can 
		     plot for multiple days 
		   * basically a build up of the previous two versions
