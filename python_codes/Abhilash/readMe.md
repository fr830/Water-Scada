Programs:-

All programs are pretty similar. The output differs a bit

1. tunivalasa.py - *cleans the data
		   *normalizes the data
		   *plots the graph for 1 day only

2. Narsha.py - only difference here, is that, it plots for 3 days
3. analytics.py - a more generalized(rather a modified version) approach that can 
		  plot for multiple days
